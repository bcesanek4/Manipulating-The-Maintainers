# Manipulating-The-Maintainers
A repository dedicated to storing materials relating to ongoing XZ-Utils social engineering analysis.

This project aims to demonstrate that automated sentiment analysis of open source message forums is a viable technique to detect and combat the efforts of malefactors to social-engineer open source repository maintainers, ultimately protecting the integrity of the global open source supply chain. The project presents the process of using prompt engineering as a means to fine-tune commercially available AI to correctly identify cases of malignant social engineering, and also discusses the corresponding rates of detection accuracy and correct message classification produced by the tuned AI model.
